## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

A donation system that only the verified user who have passed the background
check can initiate a new donation. Other users can only make a donation to the project they are
interested in. There are two types of donation, one is the money and the other type is material
resources, like, cloth, shoes, etc. The user who receive the donation need to set the total amount
of money they need, once the donation amount reach the goal for the project, the project will be
closed automatically. The website manager can manage user data and project data, and prove
which users can initiate the donation. User need to register their credit card in order to make
donation
